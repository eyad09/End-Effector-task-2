# End-Effector-task-2
The end effector in last assembly is not good for robot fight so we replace it with new end effector by hand drawing in cinema 4D.
This part has 4 amazing blades to hit the balloon and if we put the right motor the whole part will spin in one direction to improve the force of the blades.
the the way how to assemble it in next task
